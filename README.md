# Comparing Voting Rules for Participatory Budgeting

This project is essentially a pipeline, consisting of the parts:

- Data generation: generating voters' utilities for some projects. See the folder 'utilities'.
- The voting stage: convert utilities into ballots of a certain format (e.g. approval voting). See the folder 'voting'.
- The budgeting stage: convert the ballots into a selection of projects.
- The evaluation stage: evaluate the selection of projects with metrics like satisfaction.

## Data generation
There are two possible methods to generate the utilities.

- Random:
- Mallows model:

## Voting stage
The methods of voting that have been implemented are:

- Approval voting
- K-approval voting
- Threshold approval voting
- Knapsack voting
- Value-for-money voting
- Utility voting
- ...

## Budgeting stage
Not done yet. We currently only use knapsack budgeting.

## Evaluation stage
